This project aims at developing a single Website Development Framework that provides a useable system along with an easy development platform for websites. This project can be placed somewhere between a Content Management System and a Web Operating System. It provides a system for storing, controlling, versioning, and publishing of different kinds of electronic media such as articles, documents, manuals, images, audio, video, etc. To provide such functionality, this Project derives concepts from a Web OS such as Application Development, Install/Uninstall Facility, Package Management, Code Security & Integrity, File Management, etc. It is just not limited to the features mentioned above. Being a Development Framework, it opens up unlimited opportunities.
